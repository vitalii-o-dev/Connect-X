# Connect-X

Two people are working on this project :

  Ivan Cherepii as a front-end developer 
  
  Vitalii Oliinyk as a back-end developer

We are going to create a game, which has X rows by Y columns, players throw a coin one after another into the "board", when the user gets 4 coins in line(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) - they diappear. the game continues untill there are place on the board. User who destroyed more "lines of 4" wins.

After the end of the first sprint, we should have a Progressive Web App, which has a button play 1vs1 offline. after pressing this button, a window pops up which asks for the name of two players. After pressing done, the game should start. after finishing the game, we should see the score, and buttons "start again" and "go to the main menu". 

game should be available for use from mobile phones.
